v3.0 - Oct 2018 -- Sketch2 updates

  mapgen.lua
    - if (nssb.mymapgenis~=6) and (nssb.mymapgenis~=7) then
    -- if 7 is max, then (not 6) and (not 7) is the same as range(1-5)
    + if nssb.mymapgenis < 6 then

    - post_effect_color = { a=800, r=1, g=1, b=1 }
    -- alpha range(0-255)   800 is right out

    -- will change portal to use a "hold-item-and-punch" function instead of ABM's
    -- it's bad enough to use ABM's for this, but what's with that timer function?


  nodes.lua
    - for i = 1, 32 do  minetest .register_ore({...})
    -- why loop?  you only have to register once
